# eshop_api
<p>This application try to use .net 6 api to create RESTful API for front-end use and the whole solution architecture created from scratch and by myself.</p>
<p>There are two types of API, one is normal API without un-authentication and the other API requires authentication. The authentication method is Basic Authentication. The API under route of 'admin' can be accessed under authentication and the defalut account and password provided for testing is</p>
<ul>
  <li>user: admin</li>
  <li>password: admin123</li>
</ul>
<p>The Restful API interface is still under process though we have some endpoints already. Those Endpoints can be seen as demo to show my basic knowledge of .net API devolopment.</p>
<p>The following list is the current working endpoints</p>
